    "This is a set of 12 monthly returns of an asset, actually, of two assets. There's the blue asset, and there's the orange asset. Now clearly, they're both different in some way. The blue asset is a lot less volatile, and you can see that it tends to have less variation, and the orange asset is a lot more volatile. But what's interesting is both of these assets have exactly the same monthly return of 1%, so we're looking at 12 returns, that means 12 months, and it's, 1% is the average return of both of these assets. But clearly they are not behaving the same. \n",

    "So right away, we should be able to tell that **average returns are not a good way to look at how an asset behaves**. The average return can, as we'll see, be quite misleading.\n",

    "\n",
    "One way of trying to understand the difference between these is by looking at what would happen if you invested in these two assets. So if you look at this chart, what happens is, I've put $1,000 in both of these assets at the start of the year, and I look at how it's done during the course of the year. And you can see the blue asset sort of chugs along and does fairly well, and the orange asset is all over the place. And for a good part of the year, It looks like the orange asset might have been the smart thing to be in, but it actually ends the year lower.\n",
